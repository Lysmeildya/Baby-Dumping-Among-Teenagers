                    <h2>The Solution to Prevent Baby Dumping</h2>

                    <h3>Baby Hatch Area</h3>
                    <p>A 'Baby Hatch' is safe haven fro baby and newborn baby whose birth mother or parents can drop them off and be assured the babies will be safe and given proper care. These birth mothers or parents have decided they are not in a position to keep the baby.</p>
                    <p>Many argue that having more baby hatches may encourage more acts of sexual activites with youths, but that is far from the case. When youths lack reproductive heath education, getting pregnant and baby hathces are the last thing that will come to their mind. Baby hatches will only come to mind at the very last minute after knowing they got pregnant. That is why baby hatches are necessary, as the hatches provide a safe place for mothers or parents to leave their baby, knowing the baby will receive the love and care of an adoptive family. It also prevents unplanned babies being dumped into unsafe enviroments.</p>

                <h3>How Baby Hatch Work ?</h3>
                <p>Since the baby hatches may be new to peole nowdays, so there may no information on how the mothers or parents can leave their baby in the baby hatches. Here is the step that they can follow:</p>
                <p>Step 1:Open the baby hacthc's door.</p>
                <p>Step 2: Put the Baby gently on the cot.</p>
                <p>Step 3: Fill up and sign the consent form to put the baby up for adoption.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Place the signed form and the baby's medical and birth certificate in the box provided, if have one. Then, close the door.</p>
                <p>The baby hatch has a 24 hour CCTV inside, which will not identify the mother, but is there to alert the caretaker when a baby is left in the hatch. Once the baby is inside the hatch and the hatch's door is closed, it will be locked from the outside to keep the baby safe from any intruders or animals.There will be a few minutes of privacy given to the birth mother before the caretaker takes away the baby to give a proper care to the baby. If the birth mother has change her mind, there is an intercom next to the hatch where the mother can speak to the caretaker and the necesary arrangement will be made.</p>

                    <h3>Provide Proper Sex Education in School.</h3>
                <p>There is nothing simple about teaching kids about sex. In these time of precocius pre-teens, pregnancy among teenagers and sexual transmitted disease, children and adolescents need much more than one-time chat about the private part. Pregnancy prevention and safe sex really should ongoing, age-appropriate topics.</p>
                <p>Ideally, children will get all of the information they need at home from their parents, but school also should be an important source of information. There is the reasons why comprehensive sex education should be taught in schools.</p>

                <h4>Teen need to know safer option</h4>
                <p>One of the biggest problems with abstinence-only education is that it denies teenagers the chance to learn about acceptable options other than abstinence. Given no form of sex education has been shown to effectively convince teenagers not to have sex, this is a significant problem.
                Presumably, parents and educators want adolescents to be as healthy and happy as possible. One would be true even if those adolescents are not managing to conform to the standards of behaviour that adults would consider ideal.</p>
                <h4>Sex Education Does Not Encourage Sex</h4>
                <p>Comprehensive sex education does not encourage kids to have sex. Just like abstineces-only programs, good comprehensive programs teach students that abstinence is the only surefire way to prevent pregnancy. The diference is that these program also give students realistic and factual information about the safety of various sexual practices, and hoe to improve the odds.</p>
                <h4>Lower the Rate of Sexual Abuse</h4>
                <p>There are many teenagers who are sexually abused but do not come forward to the authoritie about it and sometimes it is due to the fact that they do not comprehend what sexual abuse is. Teenagers are often vulnerable and can be preyed on without them even noticing.When they do not receive the proper education about the subject, they do not know taht people can take advantages of them sexually.</p>
